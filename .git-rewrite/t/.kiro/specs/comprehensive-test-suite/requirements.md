# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The comprehensive test suite will provide complete test coverage for the Nephoran Intent Operator, ensuring reliability, maintainability, and correctness of all system components. The test suite must support both Windows and Linux environments, provide fast feedback during development, and integrate seamlessly with existing CI/CD pipelines.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Controller Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive controller tests, so that I can ensure the reconcile logic works correctly and handles all edge cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an E2NodeSet resource is created THEN the controller SHALL create the appropriate number of ConfigMap resources
2. WHEN an E2NodeSet is scaled up THEN the controller SHALL create additional ConfigMap resources with proper owner references
3. WHEN an E2NodeSet is scaled down THEN the controller SHALL delete excess ConfigMap resources
4. WHEN a NetworkIntent is created THEN the controller SHALL process it through the LLM and update the status appropriately
5. WHEN controller operations fail THEN the system SHALL implement proper retry logic with exponential backoff

### Requirement 2: Integration Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want end-to-end integration tests, so that I can verify the complete workflow from intent to deployment works correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a natural language intent is submitted THEN the system SHALL process it through LLM, generate deployment files, and commit to Git
2. WHEN multiple components interact THEN the system SHALL maintain data consistency and proper error propagation
3. WHEN external services fail THEN the system SHALL handle failures gracefully and provide meaningful error messages
4. WHEN the system recovers from failures THEN it SHALL resume processing from the correct state
5. WHEN integration tests run THEN they SHALL complete within reasonable time limits (< 5 minutes total)

### Requirement 3: API Validation Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive API validation tests, so that I can ensure CRD schemas are enforced correctly and provide good user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CRD schemas are registered THEN they SHALL enforce all validation rules correctly
2. WHEN invalid resources are submitted THEN the API SHALL reject them with clear error messages
3. WHEN required fields are missing THEN the validation SHALL fail with specific field information
4. WHEN schema updates occur THEN backward compatibility SHALL be maintained for existing resources
5. WHEN validation errors occur THEN they SHALL provide actionable feedback to users

### Requirement 4: Service Component Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want thorough service-level tests, so that I can ensure individual components work correctly in isolation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN LLM client processes intents THEN it SHALL handle various intent types and return valid responses
2. WHEN Git operations are performed THEN they SHALL handle authentication, conflicts, and network issues properly
3. WHEN service components encounter errors THEN they SHALL implement appropriate retry and fallback mechanisms
4. WHEN services are under load THEN they SHALL maintain acceptable performance characteristics
5. WHEN service dependencies are unavailable THEN components SHALL degrade gracefully

### Requirement 5: Cross-Platform Compatibility

**User Story:** As a developer, I want tests that work on both Windows and Linux, so that the entire team can run tests regardless of their development environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests run on Windows THEN all file path operations SHALL use cross-platform path handling
2. WHEN tests run on different operating systems THEN they SHALL produce consistent results
3. WHEN external dependencies are required THEN they SHALL be properly mocked or made available cross-platform
4. WHEN test cleanup occurs THEN it SHALL work correctly on both Windows and Linux file systems
5. WHEN performance tests run THEN they SHALL account for platform-specific performance characteristics

### Requirement 6: Test Infrastructure and Maintenance

**User Story:** As a developer, I want well-organized and maintainable test infrastructure, so that adding new tests is straightforward and existing tests remain reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new tests are added THEN they SHALL follow established patterns and integrate with existing test suites
2. WHEN test utilities are needed THEN they SHALL be available in a shared, reusable package
3. WHEN test documentation is needed THEN it SHALL be comprehensive and up-to-date
4. WHEN test data is required THEN it SHALL be managed through fixtures and factories
5. WHEN tests execute THEN they SHALL provide clear coverage reporting and integration with build systems
