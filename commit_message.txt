feat: Implement full end-to-end system integration

This commit delivers a feature-complete, integrated system. It finalizes the end-to-end workflow from the `NetworkIntent` custom resource to the backend services and O-RAN adaptors.

Key changes include:
- **Controller Integration:** Refactored the `networkintent_controller` to communicate with the `llm-processor` via HTTP, creating a fully decoupled, service-oriented architecture.
- **Service Hardening:** Updated the `llm-processor` and `rag-api` to handle the integrated workflow, including robust error handling and request/response processing.
- **Build & Test Fixes:** Resolved numerous compilation errors, linting issues, and broken tests. This involved generating missing Kubernetes code, fixing type mismatches, correcting component interactions, and rewriting the test suite to use a modern, mock-based approach.
- **Deployment:** Added Dockerfiles for all services and updated the Kustomize configurations to enable a complete, one-step deployment of the entire system.
- **Knowledge Base:** Expanded the RAG pipeline's knowledge base with more realistic telecom documents to improve intent processing.
