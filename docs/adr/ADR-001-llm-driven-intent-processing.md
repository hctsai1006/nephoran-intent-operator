## Context and Problem Statement

The telecommunications industry requires a paradigm shift from traditional imperative, command-based network operations to an intent-driven approach. Network operators need to express high-level business objectives in natural language (e.g., "Deploy a high-availability AMF instance for production with auto-scaling") and have these automatically translated into concrete, compliant network function deployments.

### Key Requirements
- **Natural Language Processing**: Accept and interpret complex telecommunications intents expressed in natural language
- **Domain Expertise**: Understand telecommunications-specific terminology, concepts, and best practices
- **Accuracy**: Achieve >95% accuracy in intent interpretation for production deployment
- **Flexibility**: Handle variations in expression, incomplete specifications, and contextual understanding
- **Performance**: Process intents with <2 second P95 latency for responsive operations
- **Cost Efficiency**: Maintain operational costs within budget constraints for high-volume processing
- **Auditability**: Provide complete traceability of decision-making process

### Current State Challenges
- Manual translation of business requirements to technical configurations requires deep expertise
- High error rates in manual configuration (industry average 20-30% misconfigurations)
- Lengthy deployment cycles (days to weeks) for complex network functions
- Lack of standardization in how intents are expressed and processed
- Limited ability to leverage organizational knowledge and best practices

## Decision

We will implement an LLM-driven intent processing pipeline using OpenAI GPT-4o-mini as the primary language model, enhanced with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for domain-specific knowledge injection.

### Architectural Components

1. **Primary LLM**: OpenAI GPT-4o-mini
   - Optimized for cost-effectiveness while maintaining high quality
   - 128k token context window for complex intent processing
   - Structured output mode for reliable parameter extraction
   - Fine-tuning capability for domain optimization

2. **Fallback Models**: 
   - Mistral-8x22b for cost optimization scenarios
   - Claude-3 for complex reasoning tasks
   - Local models (Llama-3) for air-gapped deployments

3. **Enhancement Layers**:
   - RAG system for domain knowledge injection (see ADR-003)
   - Prompt engineering framework with telecommunications templates
   - Context management for multi-turn conversations
   - Semantic validation of generated configurations

4. **Integration Architecture**:
   - Microservice-based LLM Processor service
   - Streaming support via Server-Sent Events
   - Circuit breaker pattern for resilience
   - Comprehensive caching at multiple levels

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Rule-Based Expert System
**Description**: Traditional if-then rules encoding telecommunications expertise
- **Pros**: 
  - Deterministic and predictable
  - Fast execution (<100ms)
  - No external dependencies
  - Complete control over logic
- **Cons**:
  - Brittle and inflexible
  - Exponential complexity growth
  - Cannot handle natural language variations
  - Requires extensive maintenance
- **Rejection Reason**: Cannot scale to handle the complexity and variation of real-world intents

### 2. Template Matching System
**Description**: Pre-defined templates with parameter extraction
- **Pros**:
  - Simple implementation
  - Fast processing
  - Predictable outcomes
- **Cons**:
  - Limited to predefined patterns
  - Poor handling of variations
  - No contextual understanding
  - Requires constant template updates
- **Rejection Reason**: Insufficient flexibility for diverse telecommunications scenarios

### 3. Fine-Tuned Domain-Specific Model
**Description**: Custom model trained exclusively on telecommunications data
- **Pros**:
  - Highly specialized knowledge
  - Potentially better accuracy
  - No API dependencies
- **Cons**:
  - Expensive training and maintenance ($100k+ initial, $10k+ monthly)
  - Requires extensive training data
  - Longer development timeline (6-12 months)
  - Limited general reasoning capability
- **Rejection Reason**: Cost and timeline constraints, risk of overfitting

### 4. Hybrid NLU Pipeline
**Description**: Combination of NER, intent classification, and slot filling
- **Pros**:
  - Explainable processing
  - Modular architecture
  - Good for structured intents
- **Cons**:
  - Complex pipeline maintenance
  - Limited contextual understanding
  - Difficulty with complex intents
  - Requires extensive feature engineering
