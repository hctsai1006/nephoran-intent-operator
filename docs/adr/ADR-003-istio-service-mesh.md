# ADR-003: Istio Service Mesh Integration for Microservices Observability and Security

## Title
Adoption of Istio Service Mesh for Enhanced Observability, Security, and Traffic Management

## Status
**Accepted** - Phased rollout beginning 2024-03-01

## Context

The Nephoran Intent Operator's microservices architecture requires sophisticated service-to-service communication management, comprehensive observability, and zero-trust security. As the system scales to handle hundreds of concurrent intent processing operations across multiple services, we need:

### Security Requirements
1. **Zero-Trust Networking**: Automatic mTLS between all services
2. **Fine-grained Authorization**: Service-level and method-level access control
3. **Certificate Management**: Automatic rotation and distribution
4. **Audit Logging**: Complete record of service interactions
5. **Compliance**: Meet telecommunications security standards

### Observability Requirements
1. **Distributed Tracing**: End-to-end request flow visibility
2. **Service Metrics**: Golden signals for all services
3. **Service Dependency Mapping**: Real-time topology visualization
4. **Performance Analysis**: Latency breakdown by service
5. **Error Attribution**: Precise failure point identification

### Traffic Management Requirements
1. **Load Balancing**: Advanced algorithms beyond round-robin
2. **Circuit Breaking**: Automatic failure isolation
3. **Retry Logic**: Configurable retry with backoff
4. **Traffic Splitting**: Canary and blue-green deployments
5. **Rate Limiting**: Service-level request throttling

### Benchmark Evaluation

We evaluated service mesh solutions in our staging environment with 15 microservices:

```
Test Scenario: 10,000 RPS across 15 services with mTLS enabled
----------------------------------------------------------------
Solution         | Added Latency | CPU Overhead | Memory | Features
Istio 1.21       | 0.85ms       | 0.5 cores    | 140MB  | ★★★★★
Linkerd 2.14     | 0.42ms       | 0.3 cores    | 85MB   | ★★★★
Consul Connect   | 1.23ms       | 0.4 cores    | 120MB  | ★★★
AWS App Mesh     | 1.45ms       | N/A          | N/A    | ★★★
Cilium Mesh      | 0.38ms       | 0.2 cores    | 75MB   | ★★★
```

## Decision

We will adopt **Istio 1.21+** as our service mesh platform, deploying it with the following configuration:
- Ambient mesh mode for reduced resource overhead

This decision will be reviewed:
- After each implementation phase
- Quarterly for performance impact
