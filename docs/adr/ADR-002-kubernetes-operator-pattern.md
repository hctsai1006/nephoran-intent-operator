## Context and Problem Statement

The Nephoran Intent Operator requires a cloud-native orchestration mechanism that can manage the complete lifecycle of network functions while maintaining declarative configuration, self-healing capabilities, and seamless integration with the Kubernetes ecosystem. The solution must handle complex telecommunications workloads while providing the operational simplicity expected in modern cloud environments.

### Key Requirements
- **Declarative Management**: Define desired state and let the system converge
- **Lifecycle Automation**: Handle creation, updates, scaling, and deletion of network functions
- **Self-Healing**: Automatic recovery from failures and drift correction
- **Kubernetes Native**: First-class integration with Kubernetes APIs and tooling
- **Extensibility**: Support for custom resources and domain-specific logic
- **Multi-Cluster**: Manage resources across multiple Kubernetes clusters
- **Observability**: Native integration with Kubernetes monitoring and logging
- **RBAC Integration**: Leverage Kubernetes security model

### Current State Challenges
- Traditional orchestration tools lack Kubernetes-native integration
- Generic Kubernetes resources insufficient for complex telecommunications workloads
- Need for domain-specific abstractions and behaviors
- Requirement for sophisticated state management and reconciliation
- Integration complexity with existing Kubernetes tooling

## Decision

We will implement the Nephoran Intent Operator using the Kubernetes Operator pattern with Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs), leveraging the Operator SDK and controller-runtime framework for development.

### Architectural Components

1. **Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)**
   ```yaml
   - NetworkIntent: High-level intent specifications
   - NetworkFunction: Deployed network function instances  
   - NetworkSlice: Network slice definitions
   - E2NodeSet: E2 node simulation configurations
   - TelecomPolicy: Policy definitions for network functions
   ```

2. **Controller Architecture**
   - **Reconciliation Loop**: Event-driven with exponential backoff
   - **Watch Mechanisms**: Multi-resource watching with predicates
   - **State Management**: Status subresources with conditions
   - **Finalizers**: Graceful cleanup and dependency management
   - **Webhooks**: Validation and mutation for admission control

3. **Operator SDK Framework**
   - controller-runtime for core functionality
   - client-go for Kubernetes API interactions
   - apimachinery for resource definitions
   - code-generator for client generation

4. **Multi-Controller Design**
   - NetworkIntentController: Primary intent processing
   - NetworkFunctionController: NF lifecycle management
   - SliceController: Network slice orchestration
   - PolicyController: Policy enforcement
   - StatusController: Aggregated status management

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Standalone Microservice Architecture
**Description**: Traditional microservices without Kubernetes operator pattern
- **Pros**:
  - Technology agnostic
  - Simpler initial development
  - Direct control over all aspects
  - No Kubernetes dependency
- **Cons**:
  - Requires custom orchestration logic
  - No native Kubernetes integration
  - Complex state management
  - Missing self-healing capabilities
  - Separate deployment and lifecycle management
- **Rejection Reason**: Loses significant Kubernetes platform benefits and increases operational complexity

### 2. Serverless Functions (FaaS)
**Description**: Event-driven functions on platforms like Lambda or OpenFaaS
- **Pros**:
  - Zero infrastructure management
  - Automatic scaling
  - Pay-per-use pricing
  - Simple deployment
- **Cons**:
  - Stateless execution model unsuitable for orchestration
  - Limited execution time (15 minutes max)
  - Complex state coordination
  - Vendor lock-in concerns
  - Poor fit for long-running reconciliation
- **Rejection Reason**: Fundamental mismatch with stateful orchestration requirements

### 3. Helm-Only Solution
**Description**: Pure Helm charts without custom operators
- **Pros**:
  - Familiar tooling
  - No custom code required
  - Wide ecosystem support
  - Simple packaging
- **Cons**:
  - Limited to install-time configuration
  - No runtime reconciliation
  - Cannot handle complex logic
  - No custom resource types
  - Limited lifecycle management
- **Rejection Reason**: Insufficient for dynamic network function management

### 4. External Orchestrator Integration
**Description**: Integration with tools like Terraform, Ansible, or Puppet
- **Pros**:
  - Mature tooling
  - Multi-cloud support
  - Existing expertise
  - Rich feature sets
- **Cons**:
  - Not Kubernetes-native
  - Complex integration requirements
  - Impedance mismatch with Kubernetes model
  - Separate state management
  - Limited container orchestration capabilities
- **Rejection Reason**: Poor integration with Kubernetes ecosystem and cloud-native principles

### 5. Service Mesh Controllers
**Description**: Leverage Istio, Linkerd, or similar service mesh operators
- **Pros**:
  - Advanced traffic management
  - Built-in observability
  - Security features
  - Existing operators
- **Cons**:
  - Limited to network layer concerns
  - Cannot manage application lifecycle
  - No support for custom resources
  - Focused on service-to-service communication
- **Rejection Reason**: Scope limited to network traffic management, not application orchestration

    client.Client
    Scheme *runtime.Scheme
    Recorder record.EventRecorder
    RateLimiter workqueue.RateLimiter
}

// Watch configuration with predicates
func (r *NetworkIntentReconciler) SetupWithManager(mgr ctrl.Manager) error {
    return ctrl.NewControllerManagedBy(mgr).
        For(&v1.NetworkIntent{}).
        Owns(&v1.NetworkFunction{}).
        WithEventFilter(predicate.GenerationChangedPredicate{}).
        WithOptions(controller.Options{
            MaxConcurrentReconciles: 10,
            RateLimiter: r.RateLimiter,
        }).
        Complete(r)
}
```

### Resource Management Strategy
