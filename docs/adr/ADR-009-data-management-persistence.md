# ADR-009: Data Management and Persistence Strategy for Production Scale

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2024-12-15  
**Deciders:** Data Architecture Team, Site Reliability Engineers, Security Team  
**Technical Story:** Design production-grade data management strategy supporting enterprise scale with ACID guarantees, disaster recovery, and compliance requirements

## Context

Enterprise telecommunications environments require robust data management strategies that ensure data consistency, availability, and durability while meeting strict performance requirements. The Nephoran Intent Operator processes critical network configuration data that must be preserved, auditable, and recoverable across multiple failure scenarios.

## Decision

We implement a multi-tier data management strategy with polyglot persistence, automated backup and recovery, and comprehensive data governance that has been validated in production environments processing millions of network intents.
