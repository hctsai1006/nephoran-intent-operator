## Context and Problem Statement

Large Language Models, while powerful, lack specific domain knowledge about telecommunications standards, O-RAN specifications, and organizational best practices. The Nephoran Intent Operator requires a mechanism to augment LLM capabilities with authoritative, up-to-date telecommunications knowledge to ensure accurate intent interpretation and compliant network function configurations.

### Key Requirements
- **Domain Knowledge Integration**: Incorporate 3GPP, O-RAN, and vendor-specific documentation
- **Dynamic Updates**: Support continuous knowledge base updates without retraining
- **Semantic Search**: Find relevant information based on meaning, not just keywords
- **Performance**: Sub-200ms retrieval latency for real-time processing
- **Scalability**: Handle 100,000+ documents with millions of chunks
- **Accuracy**: >85% retrieval precision for technical queries
- **Multi-Modal**: Support text, tables, diagrams, and structured data
- **Version Control**: Track document versions and maintain history

### Current State Challenges
- LLMs have knowledge cutoff dates and lack recent specifications
- Generic models don't understand telecommunications-specific terminology
- Fine-tuning alone is expensive and inflexible for updates
- Traditional search methods miss semantic relationships
- Large document sets exceed LLM context windows

## Decision

We will implement a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using Weaviate as the vector database, integrated with the Haystack framework for orchestration, and OpenAI embeddings for vectorization.

### Architectural Components

1. **Vector Database: Weaviate**
   - HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) indexing for fast similarity search
   - GraphQL and REST APIs for flexible querying
   - Built-in vectorization and multi-tenancy
   - Horizontal scaling and replication support
   - Persistent storage with backup capabilities

2. **RAG Framework: Haystack**
   - Pipeline orchestration for document processing
   - Component-based architecture for flexibility
   - Support for multiple embedding models
   - Query enhancement and reranking
   - Evaluation and monitoring tools

3. **Embedding Model: OpenAI text-embedding-3-large**
   - 3072-dimensional embeddings for high precision
   - Optimized for semantic similarity
   - Support for long text sequences
   - Cost-effective API pricing
   - Fallback to local models when needed

4. **Document Processing Pipeline**
   ```
   Documents → Parsing → Chunking → Embedding → Indexing → Storage
                ↓          ↓          ↓           ↓         ↓
            Metadata  Overlap    Vectors    HNSW     Weaviate
   ```

5. **Retrieval Pipeline**
   ```
   Query → Enhancement → Embedding → Search → Reranking → Context
            ↓              ↓          ↓         ↓           ↓
         Synonyms     Vectors    Weaviate  Relevance    LLM
   ```
