# ADR-002: Weaviate as Vector Database for RAG Pipeline

## Title
Selection of Weaviate as the Vector Database for Semantic Search in the RAG Pipeline

## Status
**Accepted** - Deployed in production as of 2024-02-01

## Context

The Nephoran Intent Operator's Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline requires a vector database capable of storing and efficiently querying high-dimensional embeddings from telecommunications documentation. The system must support:

### Functional Requirements
1. **Semantic Search**: Sub-200ms query latency for nearest neighbor search
2. **Scale**: Storage and indexing of 100,000+ document embeddings
3. **Multi-tenancy**: Isolation between different knowledge domains
4. **Hybrid Search**: Combined vector and keyword search capabilities
5. **Real-time Updates**: Dynamic knowledge base updates without downtime

### Technical Requirements
1. **Indexing Algorithm**: Efficient approximate nearest neighbor search
2. **Embedding Support**: Multiple embedding model compatibility
3. **Query Flexibility**: Complex filtering and aggregation
4. **Integration**: Native Kubernetes deployment and Go client libraries
5. **Observability**: Comprehensive metrics and monitoring

### Performance Requirements
1. **Query Latency**: P95 < 200ms for 1000-dimensional vectors
2. **Throughput**: 1000+ queries per second
3. **Indexing Speed**: 10,000 vectors per minute
4. **Memory Efficiency**: < 100GB for 1M vectors with metadata
5. **Availability**: 99.9% uptime with automatic recovery

### Benchmark Results

We conducted extensive benchmarks using telecommunications documentation corpus:

```
Dataset: 45,000 O-RAN/3GPP document chunks (768-dimensional embeddings)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Database    | P50 Query | P95 Query | Index Time | Memory  | Accuracy
Weaviate    | 23ms     | 187ms     | 4.2 min    | 8.3GB   | 94.2%
Pinecone    | 31ms     | 234ms     | 5.8 min    | N/A     | 93.8%
Qdrant      | 27ms     | 198ms     | 4.7 min    | 9.1GB   | 94.0%
pgvector    | 89ms     | 423ms     | 12.3 min   | 14.2GB  | 91.3%
ChromaDB    | 45ms     | 312ms     | 6.1 min    | 10.4GB  | 92.7%
```

## Decision

We will adopt **Weaviate** as the vector database for the RAG pipeline, deploying it as a StatefulSet within our Kubernetes cluster with persistent storage and automated backup procedures.

### Rationale

1. **Superior HNSW Indexing**
   - Hierarchical Navigable Small World graphs provide O(log n) search complexity
   - Automatic parameter tuning based on dataset characteristics
   - Dynamic index updates without full rebuild
   - Configurable ef parameters for latency/accuracy tradeoff

2. **Native Multi-Modal Support**
   - Text2vec modules for automatic vectorization
   - Support for multiple embedding models simultaneously
   - Cross-modal search capabilities for future expansions
   - Built-in vectorization eliminates external dependencies

3. **GraphQL API Excellence**
   - Intuitive query language for complex searches
   - Aggregation and grouping capabilities
   - Filtering on metadata properties
   - Batch operations for efficiency

4. **Kubernetes-Native Architecture**
   - Helm charts for standardized deployment
   - Horizontal scaling with sharding
   - StatefulSet support for data persistence
   - Prometheus metrics exposure

5. **Hybrid Search Capabilities**
   - BM25 keyword search alongside vector search
   - Configurable alpha parameter for search balance
   - Metadata filtering before vector search
   - Explain API for search debugging
