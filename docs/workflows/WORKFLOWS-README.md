# GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipelines

> **üìö Note:** This document provides operational guidance for the CI/CD pipelines. For comprehensive workflow documentation including consolidation history, architecture details, and best practices, see the main [Workflows Documentation](./README.md).

This directory contains comprehensive GitHub Actions workflows for the Nephoran Intent Operator, providing automated testing, building, deployment, and security auditing with zero manual intervention.

## üöÄ Pipeline Overview

The CI/CD pipeline consists of four main workflows designed for production-ready automation:

### 1. Production Deployment Pipeline (`production.yml`)
**Trigger**: Push to `main` branch, version tags
**Duration**: ~45-60 minutes
**Purpose**: Full production deployment with comprehensive quality gates

#### 9-Stage Pipeline:
1. **Code Quality** - Formatting, linting, SAST scan, SonarCloud analysis
2. **Comprehensive Testing** - Unit (90%+ coverage), integration, E2E tests in parallel
3. **Performance Testing** - Load testing, regression detection
4. **Security Scanning** - Container security, manifest validation, secrets scanning
5. **Build and Push** - Multi-arch builds (amd64/arm64), image signing with Cosign, SBOM generation
6. **Staging Deployment** - Automated deployment with smoke tests
7. **Production Deployment** - Blue-green deployment with validation
8. **Release Management** - Changelog generation, GitHub releases
9. **Post-deployment Monitoring** - 24-hour enhanced alerting

#### Quality Gates (Pipeline Stops If):
- Code coverage < 90%
- Critical/High security vulnerabilities found
- Performance regression > 10%
- Failed smoke tests or validation
- SonarCloud quality gate failure

### 2. Pull Request Validation (`pr-validation.yml`)
**Trigger**: Pull requests to `main`, `develop`
**Duration**: ~25-35 minutes
**Purpose**: Comprehensive PR validation with auto-merge capabilities

#### Validation Stages:
- **Fast Feedback** - Basic formatting, linting, manifest validation
- **Code Quality** - Advanced SAST, vulnerability scanning
- **Testing** - Unit tests with coverage, integration tests
- **Build Validation** - Container builds, security scanning
- **Performance Check** - Benchmark impact assessment
- **Integration Validation** - End-to-end system validation

#### Features:
- Parallel execution for fast feedback
- Change detection (only runs relevant tests)
- Auto-merge for approved PRs with passing tests
- Comprehensive PR summary comments

### 3. Nightly Build Pipeline (`nightly.yml`)
**Trigger**: Daily at 2:00 AM UTC, manual dispatch
**Duration**: ~90-120 minutes
**Purpose**: Comprehensive testing and baseline establishment

#### Nightly Features:
- **Quality Baseline** - Comprehensive code analysis with trends

- Security, Compliance, Chaos, Reliability testing
- Multiple Go versions and Kubernetes clusters

### 4. Weekly Security Audit (`security-audit.yml`)
**Trigger**: Weekly on Sundays at 3:00 AM UTC, manual dispatch
**Duration**: ~60-90 minutes
**Purpose**: Comprehensive security assessment and compliance reporting

#### Security Scans:
- **SAST** - Static application security testing
- **Dependency** - Vulnerability scanning with multiple tools
- **Secrets** - Git history and code secret scanning
- **Containers** - Multi-tool container vulnerability assessment
- **DAST** - Dynamic application security testing
- **Compliance** - NIST, ETSI, ISO 27001, GDPR assessment
