2. `pr-validation.yml` - Merged into main-ci.yml 
3. `full-suite.yml` - Merged into main-ci.yml
4. `nightly.yml` - Replaced by nightly-simple.yml

**Documentation Consolidation:**
5. `docs.yml` - Superseded by docs-unified.yml
6. `docs-publish.yml` - Consolidated into docs-unified.yml
7. `link-checker.yml` - Consolidated into docs-unified.yml

**Security Consolidation:**
8. `security-scan.yml` - Merged into security-consolidated.yml

11. `govulncheck.yml` - Consolidated into security-consolidated.yml
12. `docker-security-scan.yml` - Consolidated into security-consolidated.yml

**Legacy Workflow Removal:**
13. `ci.yaml` - Superseded by main-ci.yml

### Phase 3: Consolidation Validation (COMPLETED)

  - Container scanning (Trivy)
  - Go vulnerability checks (govulncheck)
  - Static analysis (gosec)
  - SBOM generation
  - SARIF reporting
  - Security gate enforcement

#### 3. `docs-unified.yml` - Complete Documentation Pipeline
- **Consolidates:** docs.yml, docs-publish.yml, link-checker.yml
- **Features:**
  - MkDocs Material theme
  - Automated API doc generation
  - Link validation
  - GitHub Pages deployment
  - Post-deployment testing

### Phase 4: Documentation Update (COMPLETED)
- ‚úì Updated this cleanup report with final results
