# Supply Chain Security Policy
## Nephoran Intent Operator

### Executive Summary

This document defines the comprehensive supply chain security framework for the Nephoran Intent Operator, ensuring the integrity, authenticity, and security of all software dependencies throughout the development and deployment lifecycle. Our approach implements industry best practices for Go module security, automated vulnerability detection, and Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) generation.

**Security Posture**: This framework provides defense-in-depth against supply chain attacks through multiple layers of verification, monitoring, and policy enforcement.

---

## 1. Security Framework Overview

### 1.1 Core Principles

- **Zero Trust Dependencies**: All dependencies are considered untrusted until verified
- **Immutable Pinning**: All dependencies locked to specific cryptographically verified versions
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Automated scanning for vulnerabilities and policy violations
- **Transparency**: Full SBOM generation and dependency visibility
- **Rapid Response**: Automated incident response for critical vulnerabilities

### 1.2 Threat Model

Our supply chain security addresses the following threat vectors:

| Threat Category | Risk Level | Mitigation Strategy |
|---|---|---|
| Malicious Package Injection | High | GOSUMDB verification, source pinning |
| Dependency Confusion | Medium | Private module proxy, namespace controls |
| Typosquatting | Medium | Dependency review, automated scanning |
| Compromised Upstream | High | Cryptographic verification, monitoring |
| License Violations | Medium | Automated license compliance checking |
| Vulnerability Introduction | High | Continuous vulnerability scanning |

---

## 2. Dependency Management Policy

### 2.1 Approved Dependency Sources

**Primary Sources** (in priority order):
1. **Go Module Proxy**: `https://proxy.golang.org` (default)
2. **Direct Git**: For private repositories only
3. **Enterprise Proxy**: Internal proxy for air-gapped environments

**Configuration**:
```bash
export GOPROXY=https://proxy.golang.org,direct
export GOSUMDB=sum.golang.org
export GOPRIVATE=github.com/thc1006/* # Private repositories
```

### 2.2 Dependency Pinning Requirements

All dependencies MUST be pinned to specific versions:

```go
// ✅ CORRECT: Pinned to specific version
github.com/prometheus/client_golang v1.22.0

// ❌ INCORRECT: Floating version
github.com/prometheus/client_golang v1.22
```

### 2.3 Version Selection Criteria

| Dependency Type | Version Policy | Justification |
|---|---|---|
| Security Libraries | Latest stable | Critical for security patches |
| Kubernetes Ecosystem | Aligned to k8s version | Compatibility requirements |
| Core Dependencies | Conservative updates | Stability over features |
| Development Tools | Latest compatible | Enhanced development experience |

### 2.4 Forbidden Dependencies

The following types of dependencies are prohibited:

- Pre-release versions (except for tools in development)
- Dependencies with GPL/AGPL licenses (without explicit approval)
- Packages from untrusted or unmaintained sources
- Dependencies with known critical vulnerabilities
- Packages with suspicious naming patterns

---

## 3. Automated Security Controls

### 3.1 Continuous Integration Pipeline

Our CI pipeline implements multiple security checkpoints:

#### GitHub Actions Workflow: `govulncheck.yml`

```yaml
# Automated security scanning on every PR and push
- Vulnerability scanning with govulncheck
- Dependency policy enforcement
- SBOM generation and validation
- Supply chain configuration verification
- Security scorecard analysis
```

**Failure Criteria**:
- Critical or High severity vulnerabilities in active code paths
- Dependency policy violations
- go.sum integrity failures
- Suspicious dependency patterns

### 3.2 Local Development Security

#### Supply Chain Verification Script

```bash
# Run comprehensive supply chain security checks
./scripts/verify-supply-chain.sh
```

**Verification Steps**:
1. Module integrity verification (`go mod verify`)
2. GOSUMDB authenticity checks
3. Vulnerability scanning (source + binaries)
4. Dependency policy compliance
5. SBOM generation and validation
6. Security configuration review

### 3.3 Automated Dependency Updates

**Update Strategy**:
- Security patches: Immediate (automated PRs)
- Minor versions: Weekly review cycle
- Major versions: Quarterly planning cycle

**Tools**:
- Dependabot for automated PRs
- Custom scripts for security-focused updates
- Integration testing for all updates

## 4. Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)

### 4.1 SBOM Generation

We generate comprehensive SBOMs in multiple formats:

| Format | Tool | Use Case |
|---|---|---|
| CycloneDX JSON | cyclonedx-gomod | Industry standard format |
| SPDX JSON | syft | Legal compliance |
| Custom Report | go list | Human-readable format |

### 4.2 SBOM Contents

Each SBOM includes:
- All direct and transitive dependencies
- Version information with cryptographic hashes
- License information
- Vulnerability status
- Build environment metadata
- Digital signatures (where applicable)

### 4.3 SBOM Distribution

SBOMs are:
- Generated on every build
- Stored as CI/CD artifacts (90-day retention)
- Published with releases
- Shared with customers upon request

## 6. Build Tool Security

### 6.1 Tool Pinning Strategy

All build tools are pinned in `tools.go`:

```go
// Build and development tools with pinned versions
require (
    k8s.io/code-generator v0.32.0
    sigs.k8s.io/controller-tools v0.16.5
    golang.org/x/vuln v1.1.4
    github.com/golangci/golangci-lint v1.63.4
    // ... additional tools
)
```

### 6.2 Tool Installation Verification

```bash
# Install tools with version verification
go generate tools.go

# Verify tool versions
./scripts/verify-tools.sh
```

### 6.3 Secure Tool Configuration

**golangci-lint**: Includes security-focused linters
```yaml
linters:
  enable:
    - gosec        # Security issues
    - gocritic     # Code quality
    - revive       # Style and security
```

---

## 7. Private Module Proxy Configuration

### 7.1 Enterprise Deployment

For air-gapped or enterprise environments:

```bash
# Configure private module proxy
export GOPROXY=https://internal-proxy.company.com,https://proxy.golang.org,direct

export GOINSECURE=internal.company.com/*  # Only if necessary
```

### 7.2 Module Authentication

**Athens Proxy Configuration**:
```yaml
# athens-config.yaml
downloadMode: sync
downloadURL: https://proxy.golang.org
storage:
  type: disk
  path: /var/lib/athens
```
