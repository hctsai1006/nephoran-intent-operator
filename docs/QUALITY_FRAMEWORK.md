# Code Quality Framework

## Overview

The Nephoran Intent Operator implements a comprehensive code quality framework designed to maintain 90%+ test coverage and enforce strict quality standards. This framework prevents regression of improvements achieved through cleanup and optimization efforts while enabling continuous quality improvement.

## Quality Metrics

### Core Quality Measurements

Our quality framework tracks comprehensive metrics across multiple dimensions:

#### Test Coverage Metrics
- **Target**: 90%+ test coverage maintained consistently
- **Tracking**: Line coverage, branch coverage, function coverage
- **Reporting**: HTML reports, JSON exports, trend analysis

#### Code Quality Metrics
- **Cyclomatic Complexity**: Maximum 15 per function, average <8
- **Code Duplication**: <5% duplication across codebase
- **Maintainability Index**: >70/100 for all packages
- **Documentation Coverage**: >15% comment ratio

#### Performance Metrics
- **Regression Threshold**: <15% performance degradation
- **Memory Allocation**: <20% allocation increase
- **Response Time**: P95 <2 seconds for critical paths

#### Technical Debt Metrics
- **Debt Ratio**: <30% of codebase
- **High Priority Issues**: <10 outstanding
- **Resolution Rate**: Track debt velocity and burndown

### Quality Score Calculation

Overall quality score (0-10 scale) based on weighted factors:

```
Quality Score = (Coverage×30% + Complexity×25% + Duplication×20% + Documentation×15% + Maintainability×10%)
```

#### Grade Scale
- **A+ (9.0-10.0)**: Exceptional quality
- **A (8.0-8.9)**: High quality
- **B (7.0-7.9)**: Good quality
- **C (6.0-6.9)**: Acceptable quality
- **D (5.0-5.9)**: Poor quality (action required)
- **F (<5.0)**: Failing quality (immediate action required)

## Quality Gates

### Automated Quality Gates

Quality gates are enforced at multiple levels:

#### Pull Request Gates
- Minimum 90% test coverage maintained
- Zero high-severity security vulnerabilities
- All linting rules pass with zero violations
- Performance regression <15%
- No increase in technical debt ratio

#### Pre-commit Hooks
```bash
# Install pre-commit hooks
make quality-fix
git add .pre-commit-config.yaml
pre-commit install
```

#### CI/CD Pipeline Gates
- Comprehensive quality analysis on every PR
- Performance regression testing against baseline
- Technical debt trend analysis
- Quality dashboard generation

#### Release Gates
- Overall quality score ≥8.0/10.0
- Zero critical security issues
- Performance meets SLA requirements
- Technical debt within acceptable limits

## Configuration

### Quality Thresholds

Configure quality thresholds in `Makefile`:

```makefile
# Quality thresholds
COVERAGE_THRESHOLD = 90        # Test coverage percentage
QUALITY_THRESHOLD = 8.0        # Overall quality score
PERFORMANCE_THRESHOLD = 15.0   # Max performance regression %
DEBT_THRESHOLD = 0.3           # Max technical debt ratio
```

### Linting Configuration

Comprehensive linting rules in `.golangci.yml`:

```yaml
# Key configuration sections
linters-settings:
  gocyclo:
    min-complexity: 12
  dupl:
    threshold: 80
  funlen:
    lines: 80
    statements: 50

linters:
  enable:
    - gocyclo    # Cyclomatic complexity
    - dupl       # Code duplication
    - gosec      # Security analysis
    - errorlint  # Error handling
    - prealloc   # Performance optimization
```

### Performance Testing Configuration

Configure performance thresholds in test files:

```go
const (
    MaxLatencyMs     = 2000    // 2 second max latency
    MaxMemoryMB      = 512     // 512MB max memory
    MaxRegressionPct = 15.0    // 15% max regression
)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Quality Gate Failures

#### Test Coverage Below Threshold
```bash
# Identify uncovered code
make coverage
open .quality-reports/coverage/coverage.html

# Add missing tests for uncovered functions
# Focus on business logic and error paths
```

#### Linting Violations
```bash
# View detailed linting report
make lint

# Auto-fix issues where possible
golangci-lint run --fix

# Manual fixes for remaining issues
```

#### Performance Regression
```bash
# Identify performance bottlenecks
make performance-regression

# Profile specific functions
go test -bench=. -cpuprofile=cpu.prof
go tool pprof cpu.prof

# Optimize hot paths and validate improvements
```

#### Technical Debt Threshold Exceeded
```bash
# Generate debt analysis
make technical-debt

# Prioritize high-impact debt items
# Create improvement backlog
# Allocate time for debt reduction
```

### Quality Metrics Troubleshooting

#### Dashboard Not Generating
1. **Check dependencies**: Ensure all tools installed
2. **Verify permissions**: Scripts executable (`chmod +x`)
3. **Review logs**: Check error messages in output
4. **Manual execution**: Run tools individually for debugging

#### Inconsistent Results
1. **Clean cache**: `make quality-clean`
2. **Update tools**: Install latest versions of quality tools
3. **Check environment**: Ensure consistent Go version and deps
4. **Baseline reset**: Regenerate performance baselines
