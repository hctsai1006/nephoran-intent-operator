# Cloud Native Function (CNF) Deployment Guide

## Overview

The Nephoran Intent Operator provides comprehensive Cloud Native Function (CNF) deployment capabilities for telecommunications networks. This feature enables operators to deploy 5G Core and O-RAN network functions as cloud-native applications using natural language intents that are automatically processed and translated into complete CNF deployments.

## Architecture

The CNF deployment system consists of several integrated components:

### Core Components

1. **CNF Intent Processor**: Processes natural language intents to extract CNF deployment specifications
2. **CNF Orchestrator**: Manages the complete lifecycle of CNF deployments
3. **CNF Controller**: Kubernetes controller that manages CNFDeployment custom resources
4. **Template Registry**: Pre-configured Helm templates for common telecommunications functions
5. **Integration Manager**: Bridges NetworkIntent processing with CNF deployments

### Integration Points

- **LLM/RAG Pipeline**: Enhanced with CNF-specific knowledge for accurate intent interpretation
- **Nephio Integration**: Leverages Nephio R5 for package generation and GitOps workflows
- **O-RAN Compliance**: Implements standard O-RAN interfaces and specifications
- **Service Mesh**: Integrated with Istio for secure service-to-service communication
- **Observability**: Comprehensive monitoring with Prometheus, Grafana, and Jaeger
