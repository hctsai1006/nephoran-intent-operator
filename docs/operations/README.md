## Quick Reference

### Emergency Procedures

**System Down (P1 Incident):**
```bash
# Immediate response for critical system failure
./scripts/disaster-recovery-system.sh emergency-response
kubectl get pods -n nephoran-system | grep -v Running
kubectl rollout restart deployment -n nephoran-system
```

**Performance Degradation (P2 Incident):**
```bash
# Performance optimization and scaling
kubectl patch hpa llm-processor -n nephoran-system --type merge \
  -p='{"spec":{"metrics":[{"type":"Resource","resource":{"name":"cpu","target":{"type":"Utilization","averageUtilization":50}}}]}}'
kubectl scale deployment llm-processor --replicas=5 -n nephoran-system
```

**Security Incident (P1 Security):**
```bash
# Security incident response
./scripts/execute-security-audit.sh --emergency
kubectl apply -f deployments/security/emergency-network-policies.yaml
```

### Daily Operations Checklist

**Morning Health Check:**
```bash
# System health validation
kubectl get pods -n nephoran-system -o wide
kubectl top nodes
curl -f http://llm-processor.nephoran-system.svc.cluster.local:8080/healthz
curl -f http://rag-api.nephoran-system.svc.cluster.local:8080/health
```

**Performance Monitoring:**
```bash
# Check key performance metrics
kubectl get hpa -n nephoran-system
kubectl get networkintents -A | grep Processing | wc -l
kubectl port-forward -n nephoran-monitoring svc/grafana 3000:3000
```

**Security Monitoring:**
```bash
# Security status check
kubectl get networkpolicies -n nephoran-system
kubectl get secrets -n nephoran-system
./scripts/security-scan.sh --daily
```

### Weekly Maintenance Tasks

**Performance Optimization:**
```bash
# Weekly system optimization
./scripts/performance-benchmark-suite.sh
kubectl exec deployment/weaviate -n nephoran-system -- \
  curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/schema/optimize
```

**Backup Validation:**
```bash
# Backup system validation
./scripts/disaster-recovery-system.sh test
aws s3 ls s3://nephoran-production-backups/
```

**Compliance Monitoring:**
```bash
# Compliance status check
./scripts/execute-security-audit.sh --compliance=soc2

```

## Operational Excellence Standards

### Automation Principles
- **Self-Service Operations**: Automated procedures for common tasks
- **Immutable Infrastructure**: Infrastructure as Code with version control
- **Observability First**: Comprehensive monitoring and alerting
- **Security by Design**: Security controls integrated into all procedures
- **Compliance Continuous**: Automated compliance monitoring and reporting

### Response Time SLAs
- **P1 Critical**: 5 minutes (system down, security breach)
- **P2 High**: 30 minutes (performance degradation, service impact)
- **P3 Medium**: 4 hours (non-critical issues, feature requests)
- **P4 Low**: 1 business day (documentation, optimization)

### Escalation Paths
1. **Level 1**: Operations Team (24/7 on-call)
2. **Level 2**: Engineering Team (business hours + on-call)
