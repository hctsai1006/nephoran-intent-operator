                  Intent is the natural language intent from the user describing the desired network configuration.
                  The intent must be between 1 and 2000 characters and cannot contain potentially malicious content
                  such as script tags, SQL injection patterns, or command injection attempts.
                  Only printable ASCII and common Unicode characters are allowed.
                  Examples:
                    - "Deploy a high-availability AMF instance for production with auto-scaling"
