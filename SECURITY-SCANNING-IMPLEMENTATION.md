# Comprehensive Vulnerability Scanning Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive vulnerability scanning system implemented for the Nephoran Intent Operator, designed to meet telecommunications security standards and enforce zero critical vulnerabilities policy.

## Implementation Summary

### 1. GitHub Actions Workflow (`.github/workflows/security-scan.yml`)

**Comprehensive CI/CD Security Pipeline:**
- **SAST (Static Application Security Testing)**: gosec, staticcheck, CodeQL
- **Dependency Scanning**: Nancy (Sonatype), Snyk, govulncheck
- **Container Image Scanning**: Trivy, Syft SBOM generation, Grype
- **Secret Scanning**: TruffleHog, gitleaks
- **License Compliance**: go-licenses with restriction checking
- **DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing)**: OWASP ZAP
- **Policy Validation**: Conftest with OPA policies, Falco rules
- **Telecommunications Compliance**: NIST CSF, ETSI NFV-SEC, O-RAN security

**Key Features:**
- Runs on push, PR, schedule (daily), and manual trigger
- Matrix strategy for all 4 services (llm-processor, nephio-bridge, oran-adaptor, rag-api)
- SARIF format uploads to GitHub Security tab
- Consolidated reporting with PR comments
- Fail-fast on critical vulnerabilities

### 2. Enhanced Makefile Targets

**New Security Targets Added:**
```make
security-scan                 # Run comprehensive security scanning pipeline
security-scan-local          # Run local security scans (SAST + dependencies)
security-scan-sast           # Static Application Security Testing only
security-scan-dependencies   # Dependency vulnerability scanning only  
security-scan-containers     # Container image vulnerability scanning only
security-scan-secrets        # Secret detection only
security-compliance-check    # Telecommunications security compliance
security-install-tools       # Install all security scanning tools locally
security-report             # Generate consolidated security report
security-clean              # Clean security scan artifacts
```

**Integration:**
- Seamless integration with existing build process
- Local development support
- Parallel execution for performance
- Tool auto-installation capabilities

### 3. Comprehensive Security Scanning Script (`scripts/security-scan.sh`)

**Enhanced Features:**
- **Multi-tool Integration**: gosec, staticcheck, Trivy, Syft, gitleaks, TruffleHog, Nancy, govulncheck
- **Severity Classification**: Critical (CVSS ≥ 7.0), High, Medium, Low
- **Zero Critical Policy**: Build fails if any critical vulnerabilities found
- **Telecommunications Compliance**: NIST CSF, ETSI NFV-SEC, O-RAN security checks
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: HTML and JSON formats with executive summary
- **Tool Auto-installation**: Automatic tool detection and installation
- **Progressive Scanning**: Support for individual scan types

**Usage:**
```bash
./scripts/security-scan.sh --comprehensive    # Full scan (default)
./scripts/security-scan.sh --sast            # SAST only
./scripts/security-scan.sh --dependencies    # Dependency scan only
./scripts/security-scan.sh --containers      # Container scan only
./scripts/security-scan.sh --secrets         # Secret scan only
./scripts/security-scan.sh --compliance      # Compliance check only
```

### 4. Container Scanning Admission Policy (`deployments/security/container-scan-policy.yaml`)

**Kubernetes Admission Control:**
- **ValidatingAdmissionWebhook**: Enforces vulnerability scanning for all workloads
- **Policy Configuration**: Configurable thresholds (0 critical, ≤5 high)
- **Registry Control**: Allowlist/blocklist for container registries
- **Scan Validation**: Requires scan labels and recent scan dates (≤7 days)
- **Telecommunications Requirements**: O-RAN compliance, signed images, SBOM requirements

**Components:**
- Security webhook deployment with HA configuration
- Trivy server for runtime vulnerability scanning
- OPA Gatekeeper policies for advanced policy enforcement
- Network policies for secure communication
- RBAC with least-privilege principles

### 5. Security Report Generation (`scripts/generate-security-report.py`)

**Comprehensive Reporting:**
- **Executive Summary**: Risk assessment and key findings
- **Tool Integration**: Aggregates results from all scanning tools
- **Severity Analysis**: Critical/High/Medium/Low categorization
- **Compliance Status**: Telecommunications standards compliance
- **HTML Dashboard**: Professional reporting with charts and recommendations
- **JSON API**: Machine-readable format for automation

**Report Includes:**
- Vulnerability counts by severity and tool
- Detailed findings with remediation guidance
- Compliance assessment results
- Risk-based prioritization
- Executive summary for management

### 6. Critical Vulnerability Checker (`scripts/check-critical-vulnerabilities.py`)

**Zero Critical Vulnerabilities Policy:**
- **Blocking Logic**: Fails build on critical vulnerabilities
- **Smart Analysis**: Context-aware vulnerability classification
- **Tool Correlation**: Cross-references findings across tools
- **CI/CD Integration**: Returns appropriate exit codes
- **Detailed Reporting**: Comprehensive vulnerability analysis

**Critical Patterns:**
- Private keys in repository (gitleaks)
- Hardcoded credentials (gosec G101)
- High CVSS score vulnerabilities (≥9.0)
- Crypto/TLS misconfigurations
- Container privilege escalation

### 7. Telecommunications Compliance Checker (`scripts/compliance-checker.py`)

**Standards Support:**
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**: 5 categories (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover)
- **ETSI NFV-SEC**: Security zones, VNF security, NFVI security, security management
- **O-RAN Security**: A1/O1/O2/E2 interface security requirements

**Compliance Validation:**
- Automated checks against codebase and deployments
- Scoring system (0-100) with pass/fail thresholds
- Gap analysis with specific recommendations
- Integration with security scanning pipeline

### 8. Configuration Files

**Tool Configurations:**
- **`.nancy-ignore`**: CVE exceptions with justification
- **`.gitleaks.toml`**: Secret detection rules with telecommunications patterns
- **OPA Policies**: Security baseline and image security policies

**Security Patterns:**
- Telecommunications-specific secret patterns (IMSI, IMEI, 5G keys)
- Container security enforcement
- Image registry controls
- Vulnerability scan validation
