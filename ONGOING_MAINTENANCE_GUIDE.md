curl http://localhost:9090/metrics | grep nephoran_health

# 4. Review error logs from last 24 hours
kubectl logs -n nephoran-system -l app=nephoran --since=24h | grep ERROR

```

### Before Each Commit

```bash
# Run pre-commit hooks
pre-commit run --all-files

# Specific checks for different file types
if git diff --cached --name-only | grep -q "\.go$"; then
    make lint-go
    make test-unit
fi

if git diff --cached --name-only | grep -q "\.yaml$\|\.yml$"; then
    make validate-yaml

## Troubleshooting Common Maintenance Issues

### Issue: Build Time Increasing

```bash
# Diagnose
make build-profile
go build -x 2>&1 | grep -E "compile|link" | wc -l

# Solutions
1. Clear build cache: go clean -cache
2. Update dependencies: go mod tidy
3. Parallel builds: go build -p 4
4. Use build cache: export GOCACHE=/tmp/go-cache
```

### Issue: Test Coverage Dropping

```bash
# Identify untested code
go test -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...
go tool cover -html=coverage.out -o coverage.html

# Generate missing tests
gotests -all -w ./pkg/...

# Run coverage with race detection
go test -race -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...
```

### Issue: Dependency Conflicts

```bash
# Identify conflicts
go mod graph | grep "@"
go mod why <package>

# Resolution steps
go mod tidy
go mod download
go mod verify

# Force update specific package
go get -u <package>@latest
```

### Issue: Security Vulnerabilities

```bash
# Deep scan
trivy fs --severity HIGH,CRITICAL .
gosec -severity high ./...
safety check

# Remediation
make deps-update-security
make docker-rebuild
make scan-verify
```

## Emergency Maintenance Procedures

### Critical Security Patch

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# emergency-security-patch.sh

git checkout -b hotfix/security-$(date +%Y%m%d)

# 3. Apply patch
make deps-update-security

# 4. Fast-track testing
make test-security
make test-critical

# 5. Deploy to staging
make deploy-staging

# 6. Validate
make validate-staging

# 7. Deploy to production
make deploy-production

# 8. Post-deployment verification
make verify-production
```

### Performance Degradation

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# emergency-performance-fix.sh

# 1. Identify bottleneck
make profile-cpu
make profile-memory
make trace-requests

# 2. Quick fixes
make cache-clear
make connection-pool-reset
kubectl rollout restart deployment/nephoran

# 3. Validate improvement
make performance-check

# 4. Long-term fix planning
make performance-analysis > reports/perf-incident-$(date +%Y%m%d).txt
