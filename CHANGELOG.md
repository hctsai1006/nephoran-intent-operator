## [Unreleased]

### Added

#### Security Enhancements
- **Secure OAuth2 client secret loading**: Implemented robust OAuth2 client secret loading mechanism with file-based and environment variable fallbacks for enhanced security and deployment flexibility
- **OAuth2 provider configuration**: Completed comprehensive OAuth2 provider configuration system with secure provider enumeration and validation
- **Multi-provider API keys management**: Added comprehensive API keys loading system supporting multiple providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Azure) with validation and secure fallback mechanisms

#### O-RAN Functionality Improvements
- **Enhanced E2 control message handling**: Implemented explicit node ID targeting in E2 control messages for precise O-RAN network element management
- **O-RAN E2 compliance**: Added comprehensive control header parsing with full O-RAN E2 specification compliance for standards-based network operations
- **Requestor ID to node ID mapping**: Implemented flexible requestor ID to node ID mapping system supporting multiple identification schemes (PLMN, gNB, eNB)
- **YANG model XPath validation**: Added YANG model XPath validation against O-RAN schemas ensuring configuration compliance and data model integrity

#### Monitoring & Operations
- **RAG service health checking**: Implemented comprehensive RAG service health monitoring with performance metrics, component status tracking, and degradation detection

#### Development Tools
- **Individual service build targets**: Added granular Makefile build targets for individual services with Docker integration, improving development workflow and CI/CD efficiency

### Changed

#### Performance Optimizations
