## Development Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards

**Go Code Standards:**
- Follow [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html) guidelines
- Use `gofmt` and `golint` for code formatting
- Write comprehensive unit tests (aim for 80%+ coverage)
- Include integration tests for complex features
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add clear comments for complex logic

**Example Code Style:**
```go
// NetworkIntentProcessor handles the processing of network intents
// through LLM integration and validation workflows.
type NetworkIntentProcessor struct {
    llmClient    LLMClient
    ragService   RAGService
    validator    IntentValidator
    logger       logr.Logger
}

// ProcessIntent translates a natural language intent into deployment specifications.
// It returns the processed result and any errors encountered during processing.
func (p *NetworkIntentProcessor) ProcessIntent(ctx context.Context, intent *NetworkIntent) (*ProcessingResult, error) {
    // Validate input parameters
    if err := p.validator.ValidateIntent(intent); err != nil {
        return nil, fmt.Errorf("intent validation failed: %w", err)
    }
    
    // Process through LLM pipeline
    result, err := p.processWithLLM(ctx, intent)
    if err != nil {
        p.logger.Error(err, "LLM processing failed", "intent", intent.Name)
        return nil, err
    }
    
    return result, nil
}
```

**YAML/Kubernetes Standards:**
- Use consistent indentation (2 spaces)
- Include comprehensive metadata and labels
- Add descriptive comments for complex configurations
- Follow Kubernetes resource naming conventions
- Include resource limits and requests

### Testing Requirements

**Unit Tests:**
```go
func TestNetworkIntentProcessor_ProcessIntent(t *testing.T) {
    tests := []struct {
        name           string
        intent         *NetworkIntent
        expectedResult *ProcessingResult
        expectedError  string
    }{
        {
            name: "valid intent processing",
            intent: &NetworkIntent{
                ObjectMeta: metav1.ObjectMeta{Name: "test-intent"},
                Spec: NetworkIntentSpec{
                    Intent: "Deploy AMF for testing",
                },
            },
            expectedResult: &ProcessingResult{Status: "success"},
            expectedError:  "",
        },
        {
            name: "invalid intent rejection",
            intent: &NetworkIntent{
                ObjectMeta: metav1.ObjectMeta{Name: "invalid-intent"},
                Spec: NetworkIntentSpec{
                    Intent: "", // Empty intent should fail
                },
            },
            expectedResult: nil,
            expectedError:  "intent validation failed",
        },
    }

    for _, tt := range tests {
        t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {
            processor := NewTestNetworkIntentProcessor()
            result, err := processor.ProcessIntent(context.Background(), tt.intent)
            
            if tt.expectedError != "" {
                assert.Error(t, err)
                assert.Contains(t, err.Error(), tt.expectedError)
            } else {
                assert.NoError(t, err)
                assert.Equal(t, tt.expectedResult.Status, result.Status)
            }
        })
    }
