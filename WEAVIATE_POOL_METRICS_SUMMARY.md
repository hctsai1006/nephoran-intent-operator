# Weaviate Connection Pool Prometheus Metrics Implementation

## Summary

Successfully added comprehensive Prometheus metrics integration to the Weaviate connection pool in `pkg/rag/weaviate_pool.go`. The implementation follows the existing patterns in the codebase and provides thread-safe metrics recording.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Metrics Interface (`pkg/rag/weaviate_pool.go`)

- **`WeaviatePoolMetricsRecorder` interface**: Defines methods for recording pool metrics
- **`NoOpMetricsRecorder` struct**: Provides a no-op implementation for testing/disabled metrics
- **Modified `WeaviateConnectionPool` struct**: Added `metricsRecorder` field

### 2. Updated Constructor Functions

- **`NewWeaviateConnectionPool()`**: Existing constructor, unchanged for backward compatibility
- **`NewWeaviateConnectionPoolWithMetrics()`**: New constructor that accepts a metrics recorder
- **`SetMetricsRecorder()`**: Method to set metrics recorder after pool creation

### 3. Integrated with Central Metrics Collector (`pkg/monitoring/metrics.go`)

Added six new Prometheus metrics:

- **`WeaviatePoolConnectionsCreated`** (Counter): Total connections created
- **`WeaviatePoolConnectionsDestroyed`** (Counter): Total connections destroyed
- **`WeaviatePoolActiveConnections`** (Gauge): Current active connections
- **`WeaviatePoolSize`** (Gauge): Current pool size (total connections)
- **`WeaviatePoolHealthChecksPassed`** (Counter): Successful health checks
- **`WeaviatePoolHealthChecksFailed`** (Counter): Failed health checks

### 4. Updated Pool Operations

All atomic operations that modify pool state now also update Prometheus metrics:

- **Connection creation**: Records created counter and updates pool size
- **Connection destruction**: Records destroyed counter and updates pool size
- **Health checks**: Records passed/failed counters
- **Pool size changes**: Updates active connections and total size gauges

### 5. Metrics Methods in MetricsCollector

Added convenience methods for recording Weaviate pool metrics:
- `RecordWeaviatePoolConnectionCreated()`
- `RecordWeaviatePoolConnectionDestroyed()`
- `UpdateWeaviatePoolActiveConnections(count int)`
- `UpdateWeaviatePoolSize(size int)`
- `RecordWeaviatePoolHealthCheckPassed()`
- `RecordWeaviatePoolHealthCheckFailed()`

### 6. Integration Example (`pkg/rag/weaviate_pool_integration_example.go`)

Created helper functions to demonstrate proper integration:
- `IntegrateWeaviatePoolWithMetrics()`: Shows basic integration pattern
- `SetupWeaviatePoolWithMonitoring()`: Complete setup with monitoring

## Metric Names

All metrics follow the established naming convention:

```
nephoran_weaviate_pool_connections_created_total
nephoran_weaviate_pool_connections_destroyed_total
nephoran_weaviate_pool_active_connections
nephoran_weaviate_pool_size
nephoran_weaviate_pool_health_checks_passed_total
nephoran_weaviate_pool_health_checks_failed_total
```

## Usage Example

```go
// Create metrics collector
metricsCollector := monitoring.NewMetricsCollector()

// Create pool with metrics
config := DefaultPoolConfig()
pool := NewWeaviateConnectionPoolWithMetrics(config, metricsCollector)

// Start the pool
if err := pool.Start(); err != nil {
    log.Fatal("Failed to start pool:", err)
}

// Metrics will be automatically recorded during pool operations
```

## Thread Safety

The implementation maintains thread safety by:
- Using the existing atomic operations for internal metrics
- Only calling the metrics recorder interface methods, which are implemented thread-safely
- Protecting shared state access with existing mutex locks

## Backward Compatibility

- Existing code using `NewWeaviateConnectionPool()` continues to work unchanged
- Tests continue to pass without modification
- The NoOpMetricsRecorder ensures no panics when metrics recorder is nil

## Integration Points

The metrics are automatically registered with the controller-runtime metrics registry and will be exposed on the standard Prometheus metrics endpoint (`/metrics`) when the Nephoran Intent Operator is running.
