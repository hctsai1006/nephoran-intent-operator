# Security Hardening Summary - Nephoran Intent Operator

## Executive Summary

A comprehensive security hardening initiative was completed for the Nephoran Intent Operator project, addressing critical vulnerabilities and implementing defense-in-depth security controls across the entire stack.

## Security Vulnerabilities Fixed

### 1. **CRITICAL - Wildcard RBAC Permissions (FIXED)**
- **Previous State**: `oran-adaptor` ClusterRole had wildcard permissions (`["*"]` for all resources)
- **Current State**: Least-privilege RBAC with specific resource permissions
- **File**: `deployments/kustomize/base/oran-adaptor/rbac.yaml`

### 2. **HIGH - Hardcoded Credentials in CRDs (FIXED)**
- **Previous State**: Plain text credentials in ManagedElement CRD
- **Current State**: Secret references using `SecretReference` type
- **File**: `api/v1/managedelement_types.go`

### 3. **HIGH - API Keys in Environment Variables (FIXED)**
- **Previous State**: Secrets exposed via environment variables
- **Current State**: Secrets mounted as files with restricted permissions (0400)
- **Implementation**: File-based secret loading with secure helpers

### 4. **MEDIUM - Missing Network Policies (FIXED)**
- **Previous State**: No network policies for RAG, Weaviate, Document Processor, Nephio Bridge
- **Current State**: Comprehensive network policies with default deny-all
- **Files**: `deployments/kustomize/base/network-policies/`

## Security Enhancements Implemented

### 1. Kubernetes Secrets Architecture

Created comprehensive secret manifests:
- **LLM API Keys**: `deployments/kustomize/base/secrets/llm-secrets.yaml`
- **RAG API Keys**: `deployments/kustomize/base/secrets/rag-secrets.yaml`  
- **ManagedElement Credentials**: `deployments/kustomize/base/secrets/managedelement-secrets.yaml`

### 2. Secret Volume Mounts

Updated all deployments to use file-based secrets:
```yaml
volumeMounts:
- name: llm-api-keys
  mountPath: /secrets/llm
  readOnly: true
volumes:
- name: llm-api-keys
  secret:
    secretName: llm-api-keys
    defaultMode: 0400
```

### 3. Namespace-Scoped RBAC

Created granular RBAC policies:
- Service-specific roles with minimal permissions
- Namespace isolation with `nephoran-system`
- Pod Security Standards enforcement

### 4. Admission Webhooks

Implemented validation webhooks for:
- ManagedElement credential validation
- Secret content validation
- E2NodeSet configuration validation

### 5. Container Security

Verified all containers:
- Run as non-root (UID 65532 or 1001)
- Use distroless images for production services
- Implement security contexts with `readOnlyRootFilesystem`
- Drop all capabilities

### 6. Network Policies

Implemented zero-trust networking:
- Default deny-all policy
- Service-specific ingress/egress rules
- Health check allowances from kube-system
- DNS resolution for all pods

## Code Changes

### Secret Loading Implementation

Created secure secret loading in:
- `pkg/config/file_secrets.go` - Core secret loading utilities
- `pkg/rag/secrets_loader.go` - RAG-specific secret handling
- Updated all services to use file-based secrets

### Updated Components

1. **LLM Processor**
   - File-based secret loading
   - JWT secret from `/secrets/jwt/jwt-secret-key`
   - API keys from `/secrets/llm/`

2. **RAG Service**
   - Weaviate credentials from files
   - Embedding API keys from `/secrets/rag/`

3. **ORAN Adaptor**
   - ManagedElement credentials via secret references
   - TLS certificates from mounted secrets

## Security Best Practices Applied

### 1. Defense in Depth
- Multiple security layers (RBAC, NetworkPolicies, PodSecurity, Webhooks)
- Least privilege principle throughout
- Zero-trust network architecture

### 2. Secret Management
- No hardcoded secrets in code
- File-based secrets with restricted permissions
- Secret rotation support via volume updates

### 3. Container Security
- Non-root containers
- Minimal attack surface (distroless)
- Security contexts properly configured

### 4. Access Control
- Namespace isolation
- Service account separation
- Role-based access control

## Remaining Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. Replace placeholder secrets with actual values using external secret management
2. Implement cert-manager for webhook certificate rotation
3. Add security scanning to CI/CD pipeline

### Future Enhancements
1. Implement external secret operators (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)
2. Add runtime security monitoring (Falco)
3. Implement OPA Gatekeeper for policy enforcement
4. Regular security audits and penetration testing

## Compliance

The security hardening addresses:
- **OWASP Kubernetes Top 10** compliance
- **CIS Kubernetes Benchmark** recommendations
- **Pod Security Standards** (restricted level)
- **Zero Trust Architecture** principles

## Files Modified

### Critical Security Files
1. `deployments/kustomize/base/oran-adaptor/rbac.yaml` - Fixed wildcard permissions
2. `api/v1/managedelement_types.go` - Added secret references
3. `deployments/kustomize/base/llm-processor/deployment.yaml` - File-based secrets
4. `deployments/kustomize/base/rbac/namespace-scoped-rbac.yaml` - Least privilege RBAC
5. `deployments/kustomize/base/webhooks/validating-webhook.yaml` - Admission control
6. `deployments/kustomize/base/network-policies/missing-components-netpol.yaml` - Network segmentation

### New Security Files Created
- Secret manifests in `deployments/kustomize/base/secrets/`
- Namespace-scoped RBAC configurations
- Comprehensive network policies
- Admission webhook configurations

## Testing Recommendations

1. **RBAC Testing**: Verify service accounts can only access permitted resources
2. **Network Policy Testing**: Use network policy test tools to verify connectivity
3. **Secret Access Testing**: Ensure services can read mounted secrets
4. **Webhook Testing**: Validate that invalid configurations are rejected
5. **Security Scanning**: Run vulnerability scanners against container images

## Conclusion

The Nephoran Intent Operator has undergone significant security hardening, transforming from a system with critical vulnerabilities to one with comprehensive security controls. All identified critical and high-severity vulnerabilities have been addressed, with a robust security architecture now in place.
